# Polar-Coordinate-Description-of-Objects
This code is designed to translate an object from an image into a polar coordinate description.

## Description
Microscopy is a powerful tool in biology, allowing observations of biological phenomenon on the micron scale.
Under varying experimental conditions, the shapes of these objects over time need to be described in a quantitative way.
By defining a center point and sweeping out a survey radius line to describe the shape via degrees and radii, the shape of the cell can more easily be quantified.

## Implementation
The input data must be a tif file. This particular code is designed for tif stacks of images. An avi file showcasing the types of thresholded data ideal for this code is titled, "Thresholded p collini cell.avi."

Type in the file directory leading to your input tif file into the "Polar coordinate description.py" script.
